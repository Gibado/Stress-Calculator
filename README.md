# Stress-Calculator
Single page website you can use to calculate which areas of your life are elevating your daily stress.  Each metric is scored based on how close you are to what's considered dangerously too high or too low for that measurement.  An example of this is how close you are to a BMI of 13.5 as there is risk of organ failure at this BMI.

## Weight Calculations
This calculation is based on using your BMI to identify your optimal weight. Then your Basal Metabolic Rate is compared between both weights. The Basal Metabolic Rate is calcuated by using the average of the Mifflin-St Jeor and Revised Harris-Benedict Equations.

## Sleep Calculations
This calculation is based on your age and how many hours of sleep you get on average.  I used this site (https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-calculator) to identify the optimal sleep range.
